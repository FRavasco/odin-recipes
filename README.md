# odin-recipes

Repository for the recipes website made while enroled in The Odin Project.

This is my first contact with HTML and CSS, and the main skills sharpened while developing this website were:
- The basics of HTML
- HTML Boilerplate
- Elements and Tags
- Text
- Lists
- Links and images
- Begining of styling with CSS.

You can visit the resulting webpage here [The Odin Recipes](https://fravasco.github.io/odin-recipes/).
