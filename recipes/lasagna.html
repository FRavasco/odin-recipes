    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch 
        tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
        filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd 
        cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and 
        crusty garlic bread.
